This is the first in an eventual series of posts about my progress with Python. I have two goals for the series: keep a record of my own learning that I can reference later and create a roadmap of sorts for anyone looking to pick up Python informally. I am certainly not an expert in programming or pedagogy, but I hope some of the lessons I learn can be helpful.

### Background

In undergrad, I took a Programming for Astrophysics class that used Python. The class was quite specific to research and largely consisted of creating plots and visualizing astro data. I learned a lot, but definitely felt like I was lacking in Python fundamentals that I could apply to different projects. In the several years since then, I have dabbled in Excel a bit for work but didn't do any real programming until I attempted Hanukkah of Data with SQL (see my other blog posts if you're interested in that process). 

### Attempt 1- Advent of Code

Feeling cocky from my success at Hanukkah of Data and too confident in my skills from my one college Python class (which was at this point several years ago), I decided to attempt [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Python. Advent Code is like an Advent Calendar, with 25 different programming challenges. It's meant to be completed daily during December but the creators archive the puzzles so they are available all year round. A game-based approach had worked well for learning SQL so I anticipated that I would have an equally enjoyable time learning Python over the 25 nights.

Sadly, I was mistaken. I successfully completed the first day's assignment but quickly realized that my Python knowledge was not sufficient. Even if I could understand the logic for a solution, I kept getting tripped up by formatting and syntax. My boyfriend and I were working on the project 'together' (in quotes since he is a SWE who already knows Python and he is really just helping me learn) and he could tell how frustrated I was getting. At this point, I knew the only option was to do what I said I would never do.

### Going back to absolute basics

Yes, I'm being dramatic. I was very resistant to actually learning the basics of Python and wanted to stick to the method of 'figuring it out to solve the problem at hand'. Learning a coding language in the academic way seemed tedious and boring. However, my boyfriend (AKA personal tutor) suggested that I would save time and feel more confident if I actually understood what I was doing. To anyone reading this blog on their Python learning journey, I know it may seems tempting to skip past this step to get to the cool projects. The good news is that you can work on the basics and your fun ideas at the same time! 

Instead of waiting until I get to Expert Python Level, I am going to attempt other projects at the same time, hoping that the more I practice the basics, the easier it will be to do more complex programming. This approach is working for me so far since I am motivated to learn the theory for a purpose, not just because it's in the next chapter of my textbook.

Speaking of textbooks, I am using [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition). This may surprise some, but I purchased a physical book instead of the ebook and very much recommend that. I find it really helpful to be able to easily flip to different sections. There are so many free resources online (I also like [this Practice Python site](https://www.practicepython.org/)) so a book isn't strictly necessary but it is working well for me so far. I am not following the chapters in order, which also helps me stay interested. Instead, I'm skipping to what I need to do an exercise on the Practice Python website or for my personal projects.

### What next?
I've been vague on the kinds of projects I want to use Python for. That's because I need to build tension on my blog and keep my loyal readers coming back for more! I am planning more blog posts to separate out topics to keep any of my posts from getting too long. Honestly, another big challenge has been choosing what to work on. There are so many options and I feel myself being pulled into a lot of different directions as I learn more about what is possible with Python. 

### Vanquishing my enemy (Advent of Code Days 2-25)

You may have noticed that this blog post was light on actual code (including my Day 1 Advent of Code solution). I will spare you from reading my Python exercises to accept user input or to determine whether a number is even or odd. At some point, I will come back to Advent of Code and I'll include all of my code in one place/series on the blog.

### Wrapup and Takeaways

I feel like programming advice on the internet fits into two boxes- simplified for people who have never written a line of code in their life or super technical for experts/career engineers. As someone in the middle, who is familiar with coding but still has a long way to go, I hope that my blog can help anyone in the same position. I've found that the most important lesson to keep in mind is to accept that you will make a lot of mistakes. For some reason, SQL made a lot of sense to me and I was able to pick it up fairly quickly. Python has definitely been tougher! It's been helpful to have goals/projects to work towards, so even if I make mistakes I'm still invested in getting to a finished product.
