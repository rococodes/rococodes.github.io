Hello and welcome to my coding blog!

#### Who am I?
I'm Rachel. I work in tech (though not a super technical role-- but never say never). You also may have seen me [lose](https://j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=15122) [twice](https://j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=17229) on Jeopardy! In my non-work, non-programming life I enjoy crosswords, lifting weights, watching soccer (COYW), and swimming/cycling/running.

#### The Origin of Roco Codes
Roco is my nickname: Rachel Cohen --> Roco. I liked the sound of Roco Codes since it sounds like the art style Rococo and I was an Art History major back in college. Fear not, I do have a STEM background as I double-majored with Physics. I am always looking for ways to combine my analytical and creative sides and this blog name hopefully encapsulates that.

#### The Purpose/Vision
I am quite new to coding, and wanted to collect my efforts in one place. Since I'm not beholden to a particular curriculum or job, I can explore different areas. My hope is that this blog is not only helpful for me to have a record of what I've done but can also serve as a resource. 

Feel free to reach out to me at <rachel.rococodes@gmail.com>
